## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio website serves as my **digital identity** where I can share my **academic journey, technical skills, future projects, and the services I offer** as an aspiring developer. It's built with clean, responsive web technologies and is designed to grow with me as I continue to learn and build more projects.

I believe that a good portfolio not only showcases work but reflects the **energy and personality** of its creator. Hence, this site combines a **light, vibrant aesthetic** with a professional layout to ensure a memorable and approachable user experience.
